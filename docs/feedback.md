### Prototype III - Feedback

Thanks for presenting at demo day! I hope you enjoyed seeing all the other projects and got some ideas for how to improve your own. 
Before you make your final submission, please remember to do the following:
- You must add your names and group name to every .py and .md file. 
- Where is your structural diagram, which describes the components of your program?
- A rubric (i.e., list of features and cool stuff) should be added.
- Now is the time to finish your doc strings.
- Finally, don't forget that your Project Video and Individual Project Reflection are both due on May 5th, 2022.

**Headers**:   
Please make sure you have full headers in all your .py and .md files!

**Read Me**:   
You don't have any readme-- please make sure you have that for next time :)

**Group Contract**:   
You don't seem to have your group contract, please add that!

**Sprint Planning**:   
Please add your sprint planning.

**Code/Program**:   
Your code looks good overall. It might be useful to see a few more comments, but otherwise it seems like you have a handle on things. My other suggestion would be to go through and remove anything that doesn't actually have a point later on-- I've tagged a few of those instances. It could be that those will be useful features later, but without the readme, it's hard for me to tell if you're on track to meet your goals or not, so I'm not sure what your next features are!

**Other Comments**:  
I like that you have your pseudocode here as well! Keep up the good work.
