## Sprint Planning
### Prototype I

Features:
* 4 Princesses (Tiana, Merida, Moana, and Rapunzel) were used to for the first protoype
* This version only had 5 questions, each with 4 possible answers where 1 answer correlated to 1 of the 4 princesses.
* The user was asked to answer the questions using the keyboard by typing either 1,2,3 or 4.
* At the end of the questions, the user was met with "Your princess is [insert princess with maximum score]"

Tasks:
* several files were made including the readspreadsheet.py, images folder, pseduocode.txt, and the princessdata.csv (see readme.md for more information)
* In the readspreadsheet.py a Questions class was made and other functions in order to read the questions on the csv into the game.
* A dictionary of the answers corelating to the princesses was made

### Prototype II

* 9 Princesses (Tiana, Merida, Moana, and Rapunzel) were used to for the first protoype
* This version had 15 questions, each with 9 possible answers where 1 answer correlated to 1 of the 9 princesses.
* The user was asked to answer the questions using the keyboard by typing either 1-9.
* At the end of the questions, the user was met with "Your princess is [insert princess with maximum score]" with the addition of a description of the each princess.

Tasks:
* new information was added to pre-existing files
* a new file including a button class for the user to click on was made
* images of each princess was added at the end of the game

### Prototype III
* 9 Princesses (Tiana, Merida, Moana, and Rapunzel) were used to for the first protoype
* This version had 15 questions, each with 9 possible answers where 1 answer correlated to 1 of the 9 princesses.
* The user was asked to answer the questions by clicking on the answer that best resonates with them.
* At the end of the questions, the user was met with "Your princess is [insert princess with maximum score]" with the addition of an image and description of the each princess.

  Tasks/New Features:
* a windows.py file was created to construct graphic windows
* images were added to go along with the questions and answers
* the user will now by clicking on the best answer instead of typing their answer into the keyboard
* old files were updated as well as more call functions in the main.py
  



## User Personas

_Insert user personas activity from class here._

1.) Jessica is a 10 year old child whose parents just told them they are going to go Disney for the first time. Jessica is absolutely obsessed with Disney specifically Disney princesses. She doesn't know which princess she wants to dress as for the trip so her mother lets her use the internet for the first time and she comes across this personality quiz. 


2.) Adam is applying to work at Disney and has to prepare for an interview but doesn't know much about the various princesses. Using the personality quiz, he's able to get better idea on each princesses personality. 


3.) Alex is 21, they are bored and surfing the web, they love taking different personality quizzes and decide to play the princess game because they feel nostalgic about the movies they watched as a child.
## Project Structure 
In the images folder, the image labeled "Game_Diagram" displays our groups original diagram but our resulting game changed a bit in how we structured questions. The diagram displays that we have the possible responses for users listed as A through F, but we decided to take a different approach by instead removing an order for the possible answers. In addition, we removed having the "your princess is... loading gif" window as we felt that it was unecessary to be included in our project.
