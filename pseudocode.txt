def quiz 
 #going through the question dict and get user input answer for each question/key in the dict
- something like:
for question in questions_dict.items():
  print(question)



At the end: 
- count all the points
if there is a tie:
pick a character from the tie randomly




main idea:
create a dictionary of all the questions and the answers
create a different dict of the amount of points each questions has
create a dict of which answer corresponses to which princess 

questions:
- do we still need to use an excel sheet 
- is working with dict okay for this 
- dict are made but how would we start the for loop 

Notes:
-questions class
-distributor class from library past assignment
-Questions into class instead

**Create spreadsheet in effor to read questions class
